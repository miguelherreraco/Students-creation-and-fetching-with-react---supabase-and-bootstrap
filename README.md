# Students Records with React + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase + Bootstrap

This project is a prototype that allows saving and fetching student records utilizing React + TypeScript + Vite + Supabase + Bootstrap

This templates provides a brief explanation of the architecture and the instructions to get this project running.

Let's first understand the architecture of the project.

## Project Architecture

This project has 4 main layers:
- Components for the interface
- Hooks for the database functions
- Service for database configuration
- Models to prototype the students and any required object

This architecture allows independence from database since any other database could be implemented within the app. 

All componentes are segregated in order each one to be resuable.
